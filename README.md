# Weather-Journal App Project
Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Weather Journal App Project

## Overview
This project required the creation of an asynchronous web app that uses the OpenWeather API for collecting weather data and then dynamically updating the UI of a weather journal.

At the UI the user can type in a ZIP code (postcodes) and click on the 'Generate' button. The URL for the API is dynamically created and the current weather data is collected from the API using fetch.

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
To get the server on node running with the default port number, at the command line type: node server.js
The server will respond with a console.log of :
server running
running on localhost: 8000
